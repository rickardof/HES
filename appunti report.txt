1. Project specs you can rearrange the specs you already have (but not copy) and some insights (why AES stream cipher is different from block etc)
2.HIgh level model
3.Microsoft visio for RTL design, you need just to draw the essential registers and behaviour, remember clock signal and bus symbol ( slashed arrow with 8 bits)
4. Interface specifications and expected behaviour: how to draw in_valid, inputs, and what are ouputs (the user should provide input, clock latency, after 10 clock cycles output will be generated etc..)
5. functional verification (sort of diagram representation, which tests you performed and why): tests that show how the logic work
6. FPGA Implementation results: quartus reports, usage, frequency STA, consumption of registers (check verification from code like slides), if usage 1% you can say that the fpga is oversized for module so you can say it can integrate other modules and host them


efficiency is not required, but could be asked at the exam why you got this frequency from the project and what approach (cascade etc.) could improve it/worsen it, and at what cost

virtual pin assignment should be done
