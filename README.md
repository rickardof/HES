### Project Specifications 
An introduction to the project, including the specifications and their analysis. 
 
### High-level Model 
The description of the high-level model (C/C++ or Python) 
 
### RTL Design 
The description of the RTL design architecture, with block diagrams, schematics (functional and/or architectural), FSM diagrams, etc ... 
 
### Interface Specifications and Expected Behavior 
The description of how our module should be used in terms of how inputs should be provided (including timing) and what the corresponding output(s) would be. In practice, a kind of user manual, which may also include the waveforms at the input and/or output for several use cases (main case(s) and possible corner case(s)). 
 
### Functional Verification 
The description of how we tested the module, the testbench(es) architecture, and the test(s) we performed to verify that our module works according to the expected behavior.
 
### FPGA Implementation Results 
The presentation of the steps performed in Quartus (including the FPGA device used), the corresponding results such as resource usage, maximum frequency, ... including comments on the results
